# RDBMS-PROJECTS

## RDBMS Assignments Repository
This repository contains a collection of assignments completed for the RDBMS (Relational Database Management Systems) class. Each assignment focuses on analyzing different datasets obtained from Kaggle, aiming to gain insights into various aspects of database management, including structured storage, data integrity, querying and reporting, data relationships, and scalability and performance.

### Technologies Used
PostgreSQL: The projects were implemented using the PostgreSQL database management system.
DBeaver: The projects utilized DBeaver as the primary tool for interacting with the database.

### Projects Overview
The repository includes the following assignments:

- **Structured Storage:** The projects explore techniques for organizing data in a structured manner within the database, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval.

- **Data Integrity:** The objective of the projects is to maintain data integrity by implementing appropriate constraints, such as primary keys, foreign keys, and data validation rules.

- **Querying and Reporting:** In the projects, various SQL queries are formulated to extract relevant information from the datasets, and reporting functionalities are implemented to present the results effectively.

- **Data Relationships:** This assignment focuses on establishing and managing relationships between different tables in the database, utilizing concepts such as normalization and enforcing referential integrity.

- **Scalability and Performance**
